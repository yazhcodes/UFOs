# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is about building a HTML webpage to display an article about UFO Sightings, supported by data from a Javascript file and beautified by CSS & Bootstrap. We have also built a filter option to easily sift through the hundreds of UFO Sighting Data displayed in table format.

# RESULTS

## All About Aesthetics
The website features an eerie landing page to set the stage for an excited user's research into UFO Sightings. Just below the featured alien image is the Article section with Ttile and Paragraph taking up their own sub sections. The fonts for the article and the rest of the website have been carefully chosen to compliment the look and feel of the topic under discussion.




# SUMMARY
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
